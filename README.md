# Building-Detection-MaskRCNN
The aim of this project is to detect the buildings from the bird's-eye view pictures. I used
[SpaceNet dataset](https://spacenetchallenge.github.io) as a dataset. Because I had limited time,
[matterport's Mask RCNN](https://github.com/matterport/Mask_RCNN) implementation was used not to waste time by coding all the details
of Mask-RCNN.  
Lets get started..

### Project is divided into 5 steps:
#### -Download the dataset.
#### -Understand the Mask-RCNN
#### -Ä°mplement the Mask-RCNN
#### -Preprocess the data
#### -Training & Testing
